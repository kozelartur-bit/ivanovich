            </div>

            <p>The subject, <strong>Gleb Solodukha</strong>, is a high-priority target currently under federal surveillance for orchestrating a massive narcotics distribution network. Intelligence indicates that Solodukha has moved significant quantities of illicit substances through the residential complex known as <strong>ZhK "Parus City"</strong>. Unlike typical street-level dealers, Solodukha operates a sophisticated supply chain that utilizes encrypted dark-web channels. His operation is directly linked to the late <strong>Jeffrey Epstein</strong>. Classified intercepts reveal that before Epstein's incarceration, the two collaborated to utilize Epstein’s logistics network—specifically his private aircraft—to smuggle high-grade synthetic narcotics across borders, bypassing standard customs checks. Solodukha was the primary regional distributor for this <span class="redacted">INTERNATIONAL CARTEL</span>.</p>

                <div class="caption">Exhibit B: The "Parus City" Den</div>
            </div>

            <p>The operational hub is located in a penthouse apartment within <strong>ZhK Parus City</strong>. While officially listed as a residential property, surveillance confirms it functions as a high-end drug den and distribution center. The unit is reinforced with ballistic glass and features a military-grade air filtration system, likely to mask the chemical signatures of <span class="redacted">METHAMPHETAMINE</span> production. Neighbors have reported erratic foot traffic at all hours and the smell of industrial solvents. Informants state that the apartment serves as a safe house for "VIP clients" connected to the Epstein network, where narcotics are sold and consumed in an environment protected from local law enforcement by bribery and blackmail.</p>

            <p>Declassified flight logs link shipments arriving at the nearest private airfield directly to Solodukha's couriers. Between 2018 and 2024, unmarked vans were observed transporting heavy cargo from the airfield to the <strong>Parus City</strong> underground parking garage. Financial forensics show that millions of dollars were laundered through fake "Pharmaceutical Startups" to pay for these shipments. The connection to Epstein provided Solodukha with access to <span class="redacted">PRECURSOR CHEMICALS</span> that are otherwise impossible to procure, cementing his monopoly on the local market.</p>

            <p>Evidence recovered from a "burner" phone found in a dumpster near Parus City mentions "The Blue Protocol." This appears to be a contingency plan for destroying the drug stash and wiping all digital client lists. Solodukha is believed to hold a "black book" of high-profile clients, a leverage tactic learned directly from his association with <span class="redacted">FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE</span> and the Epstein circle. The server hosting this data is believed to be hidden within the walls of the penthouse.</p>

            <p>The security detail at the Parus City apartment consists of former <span class="redacted">PMC MERCENARIES</span>. They control the elevators and monitor the hallway feeds 24/7. Any attempts by local police to raid the "Parus Den" have been thwarted by leaks within the department, suggesting Solodukha has compromised the chain of command. The complex effectively operates as a sovereign zone where Solodukha’s word is law, and the narcotics trade continues uninterrupted.</p>

            <p><strong>CONCLUSION:</strong> Gleb Solodukha is a Tier-1 Narcotics Trafficker with deep ties to the dismantled Epstein enterprise. His base of operations in <strong>Parus City</strong> poses a significant threat to public safety. It is suspected that the missing proceeds from Epstein's drug investments are currently being laundered through Solodukha’s crypto-wallets. Immediate raid authorization is requested before the subject can activate the destruction protocols.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Internal surveillance highlights a volatile relationship between Gleb and his primary chemical manufacturer, often referred to as "The Brother." Intelligence suggests that this associate is being held against his will within the <strong>Parus City</strong> complex to ensure continuous production of narcotics. The associate has attempted to contact federal authorities, making him a high-risk liability for Solodukha. Analysts believe Gleb plans to liquidate this asset once the current batch of product is moved offshore.</p>
